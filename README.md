## Quick Start

### 1. Static Website
The static files in `public/` can be deployed to any static hosting service. For Cloudflare Pages:

```bash
# Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
# Connect your GitHub repo in the Cloudflare dashboard
# Set build directory to: public/
```

### 2. Contact Form Worker

Choose your preferred deployment method:

- **GitHub Actions** (Recommended): Automatic deployment on push
  - See `.github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` for complete setup guide

- **Cloudflare Dashboard**: No local tools needed  
  - See `worker/DEPLOY_NO_NPM.md` for browser-only deployment

- **Local CLI**: Traditional npm/wrangler workflow
  - See `worker/README.md` for detailed instructions
